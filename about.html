  <p itemprop="descirption" class="description text-center">Hello, My name is Adam Van-Vianen and I am a Graphic Designer.


  Growing up I have always had really weird ideas. I remember going out to fast food restaurants with my mom, and I would come up with stories on why A&W is called A&W and why Taco Bell is called Taco Bell etc. and explain why I thought they chose that certain slogan and why they chose those brand colors. In other words from a young age I was already coming up with rationales of successful organizations and didn’t even know it.<br>

  Graphic design gives me the ability to express my weird ideas and bring what goes on in my mind to life. There are no limits. I believe that creativity is one of the most important strengths and skills to have. I try to be as creative as often as possible and being a graphic designer gives me that ability. It’s like a muscle, the more you work with it the stronger it gets.

  I have always loved the aspect of art and marketing. Put those two together and you have graphic design. I believe that I can make people feel something from the work I do and communicate or influence them to do/believe what I design for the user/viewer. If I can do that then my job is complete.</p>
