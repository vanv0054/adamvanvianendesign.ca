  <p itemprop="description" class="description text-center">This isometric design is based off of the theme of a passage of time. For this design to communicate that theme I chose to design the passage of time through a relationship and true love.
  However, instead of people I decided to go with something not of the norm and show the passage of time of a relationship but with two things that go perfect together; peanut butter an djam.
  This design shows the first stage of a first date, to them getting married, to finally having a child, which in this case since it is peanut butter and jelly, their child is none other than a PB and J sandwhich.
