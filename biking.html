  <p class="description text-center">Biking Buddy is an app for anyone who likes an adventure to maybe even travel. It's designed for people to search for trails to bike on all around the world and to have directions on where to go on the trail without any data on their phone.
    This app allows the user to download trail maps so then they don't need 3G on their phone when biking through a new trail to find their way. It's simplicity and clean design makes it easy for the user to find their way throuhg the app and achieve any task they wish.
